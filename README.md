## ThreeFifteen

ThreeFifteen is an open-source school bus status tracker, built for my high school, [GHS](https://ghs.greenwichschools.org)

**Note:** for ThreeFifteen admins, see [here](https://songtech-0912.github.io/ThreeFifteen-App/admin-v2/) for the admin login and contact me for the password; for students of GHS, see [here](https://songtech-0912.github.io/ThreeFifteen-App/client-v2/) for the client. The app is designed to be used by one admin, though unlimited clients may connect.

## Features

- Modern and intuitive UI
- Decentralized (works with any server that you use)

## Guarantees

- Fully free software (no proprietary stuff)
- No build system, completely ready out-of-the-box
- Use native web technologies as much as possible
- Cross-platform (thanks to the web :)
